==== Kafka cost control is never ready

If the kafka-cost-control pod is never ready there are good chances that it is waiting on a topic before it can start. If you look closely in the log you will see a message like this:

[source,log]
----
2024-02-06 15:46:34,739 WARN  [io.qua.kaf.str.run.KafkaStreamsProducer] (pool-5-thread-1) Waiting for topic(s) to be created: [non-existing-topic]
----

As soon as you create the missing topic(s), you should be good to go. Look again at the <<section-topics>> section for more information on how to create a topic.

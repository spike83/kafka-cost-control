== Pricing rules

Pricing rules are a way to put a price on each metric. The price will be applied on the *hourly* aggregate.  Also, it's common for metrics to be in *bytes* and not Megabyte or Gigabyte. Keep that in mind when setting the price.
For example, if you want to have a price of _1.0$_ per _GB_ you will need to set the price to _1.0/1024^3^_ = _0.000976276$_ per _byte_.

Pricing rules are stored in kafka in a compacted topic. The key should be the metric name.

    baseCost
    costFactor
  }
}

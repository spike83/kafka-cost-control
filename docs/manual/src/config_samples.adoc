=== Config samples

If you want to quickly get started, you can create pricing rules and context data using the link:https://github.com/spoud/kafka-cost-control/tree/master/config[config sample folder]. All you need is node JS 20+.

Be sure to edit the files `pricing-rules.json` and `context-data.json` to match your environment.

To persist the configuration you can use the following command:

```bash
node index.js --url=https://<your-host>/graphql --user=admin --password=your-password
```

If you have issues you can try to add the `--verbose` options. This will display all the requests.

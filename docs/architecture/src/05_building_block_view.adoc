== Building Block View

////
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System

////
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

|===
|Building block | Description

| PricingRules
| Stores rules for turning usage information into costs

| ContextProvider
a|
Manages contextual information that can be used to enrich metrics with company-specific information. E.g. relations between clientIds, applications, projects, cost centers, ...


| MetricProcessor
a|
* Defines interfaces for metrics, that must be used by _MetricsScraper_ +
* Aggregates metrics into time buckets
* Produces enriched data streams which includes contextual information

| MetricsScraper
a|
* uses a metric source, such as JMX or the confluent cloud metrics API to collect usage metrics
* transforms the collected metrics into a format that is defined by _MetricProcessor_

////
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.
////



////
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system

=== PricingRules

[plantuml, target=pricingrules, format=svg]
....
@startuml
component PricingRules <<Kafka Streams App>> {

    [RuleEngine] --> [Metrics]: uses
    [RuleEngine] --> [RulesRepository]: reads
}
PricingRules -- "REST API"

queue pricing_rules <<Topic>>

[RulesRepository] --> pricing_rules: uses\n as storage
[UI] -> "REST API"
@enduml
....



=== ContextProvider


[plantuml, target=contextprovider, format=svg]
....
@startuml
component ContextProvider <<Kafka Streams App>> {
    [ContextRepository]
}
ContextProvider -- "REST API"

component Kafka {
    queue topic_context <<topic>>
    queue consumer_context <<topic>>
    queue principal_context <<topic>>

}

[ContextRepository] --> Kafka: uses as\n storage
[UI] -> "REST API"
@enduml
....


==== Context format
* metrics are defined in the core
* a metric belongs to at least one of the dimensions
** topic
** consumer group
** principal
* a context object can be attached to existing dimensions as a AVRO key-value pair to provide the needed flexibility

.topic context as JSON record in a topic, record key="car-claims"

  "topic_regex": "car-claims",
  "context": {
    "project": "claims-processing",
    "organization_unit": "non-life-insurance",
    "sap_psp_element": "1234.234.abc"

If naming conventions are very clear they could also be provided as a file / configuration.


[source,json]
.principal context as JSON record in a topic, record key="cluster-id-principal-default-ctxt"
----
{
  "type": "PRINCIPAL_CONTEXT",
  "principal_id": "u-4j9my2",
  "context": {

  }
}

INFO::
Context objects will be started as AVRO messages. We use JSON as a representation here for simplicity.

==== Context Lookup

State stores in Kafka Streams will be used to construct lookup tables for the context.

.context lookup table
|===
|Key |Value

|<type>_<cluster-id>_<principal_id>
|<context-object>

|PRINCIPAL_lx1dfsg_u-4j9my2_2024-01-01
|{"principal_id": "u-4j9my2","context": {...}}
|===

Once the table has been loaded, aggregated metrics can be enriched with a KTable - Streams join.

INFO::
In a later stage we will need to add the possibility to specify validity of such context objects (e.g. valid_from: 2024-01-01)

=== Solution Strategy

==== Used Technologies


|===
|Technology | Reason

| Telegraf
a|
* Used for scraping metrics from data sources like Prometheus agents or Confluent Cloud API.
* Versatile and lightweight tool that can be run in all environments.
* supports Kafka

| Kafka
| for storing metrics, context info and pricing rules, reduces number of solution dependencies

| Kafka Streams
| for enriching metrics and storing pricing + context data into KTables

| DataStore
| A datastore, e.g. a SQL DB, will be used for the time based aggregations (e.g. end of month reporting). Avoids complex calendar logic in Kafka Streams.

==== Time based aggregations & scraping intervals

* *MetricsScraper* should ingest metrics with an interval of 1 minute for confluent cloud metrics. Other data sources can have longer intervals.
* *MetricsProcessor* aggregates metrics with short time windows of 60 minutes
** variable cost is usually defined as  _cost unit/minute_
** The window value is the accumulated cost for one hour (interpolation may be needed when data points are missing)
** this allows some tolerance for gaps in metrics and varying ingestion intervals

== Introduction and Goals
////
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider.
These include

* underlying business goals,
* essential features,
* essential functional requirements,
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
////


Many organizations have introduced Kafka either on premise or in the cloud in recent years. +
Kafka platforms are often used as a shared service for multiple teams.
Having all costs centralized in a single cost center means that there is no incentive to save costs for individual users or projects.

Kafka Cost Control gives organizations transparency into the costs caused by applications and allow to distribute platform costs in a fair way to its users by providing a solution that

* shows usage statistics per application and organizational unit
* allows defining rules for platform cost distribution over organizational units or applications
* works for most organizations, no matter if they use Confluent Cloud, Kubernetes or on-prem installations

=== Requirements Overview
////
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

1. Collection and aggregation of usage metrics and statistics from one or multiple Kafka clusters. Aggregation by time:
    * hourly (for debugging or as a metric to understand costs in near real-time)
    * daily
    * weekly
    * monthly

2. Management of associations between client applications, projects and organizational units (OU)
    * automatic recognition of running consumer groups
    * automatic detection of principals/clients
    * creation, modification and deletion of projects and OUs
    * interface to hook in custom logic for automatic assignment of clients to projects and OUs
    * manual assignment of auto-detected principals or consumer groups to projects and OUs

3. Visualization of usage statistics
    * Costs and usage statistics can be broken down interactively
    ** Summary view: total costs for timespan (day, week, month) per OU
    ** Detail View OU by category: costs by category (produce, consume, storage) for the selected OU in the selected timespan
    ** Detail View OU by application/principal/consumer-group/topic
    * Data must be made available in a format that can be used to display it with standard software (e.g. Kibana, Grafana, PowerBI), so that organizations can integrate it into an existing application landscape
    * provisioning of a lightweight default dashboard e.g. as a simple SPA, so that extra tooling is not mandatory to view the cost breakdown

4. Management of rules, that describe how costs are calculated

5. Management of rules, that describe how costs are calculated, e.g.
    * fixed rates for available metrics, i.e. CHF 0.15 per consumed GB
    * base charge, i.e. CHF 0.5 per principal per hour
    * rules can be changed at any time, but take effect at a specified start time
    * optional: backtesting of rules using historical data

6. Access Control
    * only authorized users can modify rules, OUs and projects
    * unauthenticated users should be able to see statistics

7. Observability
    * expose metrics so that the cost control app can be monitored
    * proper logging

8. Export of end-of-month reports as CSV or Excel for further manual processing

=== Quality Goals

1. *Transferability / Extensibility*: Kafka Cost Control should be modular, so that company-specific extensions can be added. +
   A core layer should contain common base functionality.
  Company specific terms or features should be separated into dedicated modules.

2. *Maintainability*: Reacting to changing requirements and implementing bug fixes should be possible within weeks.


image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

////
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):



.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
////

=== Stakeholders

////
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
